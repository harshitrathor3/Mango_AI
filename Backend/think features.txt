When I give something to AI like I have plant of tulsi than it should start tell me when to water it and how to take care of it.
          user should be able to turn on and off the feature if he no longer wants to get updates about this thing.

ek alag section me apn esa krenge ki ----- (start me QNA me nhi krenge, baad me QNA me kr skte h)
    jese jese apn log baat krte rahe - vese vese AI information store krte rehna chahiye or uss ke sections ban na chahiye ek specific screeen pe
    uss se AI automatically notification, remainders, alarms set kr skta h if user want to and if user allow in our app


Motive - 
    App apni sari chize smjh k khud se decision leke apni sari chize automatically kr dega (just confirmation required form user before final submit)




New Idea for auto prompt generation - 
        We can tell AI to auto generate prompts and than we will evaluate that prompt with QNA. If all answer satisfied then prompt returned as output othrwise this thing go in iterative manner and iteratively pormpt generation and test with QNA should happen.
